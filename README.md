What is cons and pros of TDD?

Pros
- Unit test can help to make the code easier to maintain and refactor.
- It can make the code simple elegant and modular.
- It can help the developer detect bug for each unit. 
- The test can provide live documentation.
- It can provide end user point of view to developer.
- It helps on improving designs by updating each unit.
- It helps to clarify the requirement and the developer can do the input and have the expected output.

Cons
- To make the code can be tested, the code need to be modularized.
- It requires a lot of effort and time to build and the test function also need time and effort to maintain. It is not fit for small project.
- If the project changed frequently, it will waste a lot of time and effort.
- The developer will have a learning curve to familiar with that.
